Seeing the inherent white supremacy that is so deeply embedded in academia and corporate tech is bitterly demoralizing. Yet, I stay because I have bills to pay. I have felt exhausted for years, and the exhaustion has become debilitating within the past few months. There is no way to sugarcoat that.</p>\n<p>I am constantly inundated with white guilt. Recently, I was part of a DEI (diversity, equity, &#x26; inclusion) roundtable, and the moderators wanted to split us into breakout rooms to discuss \"actionable\" things we could do to be more \"inclusive.\" Frankly, I couldn't think of any way to \"reform\" our institution to be more inclusive. I was frustrated that our diversity efforts were mirroring the white-centric anti-racism parroted in <em>White Fragility</em> (which has been critiqued by folks far more eloquent than me).</p>\n<p>My advice for other BIPOC in this position is this: <em>pick your battles</em> and do what you need to survive until you can leave. Your mere survival is resistance.</p>\n<h2>A primer on white supremacy culture</h2>\n<p>But if you choose to participate in these anti-racism discussions within your white institutions, this <a href=\"https://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/okun_-_white_sup_culture.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">primer on white supremacy culture</a> may be a useful reference. This resource was compiled by Dismantling Racism Works (dRworks) and outlines how white supremacy values manifest within our institutions.</p>\n<p>Below, I've paraphrased some of the symptoms I see most often within corporate tech and academia, along with the suggested \"antidotes.\" These symptoms can be used to recognize if you are in a toxic environment, and the antidotes may be helpful suggestions for your organizations.</p>\n<h3>Progress is \"bigger\" or \"more\"</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success is always defined as bigger or more.</li>\n<li>Growth is always the goal, no matter what the unintended consequences may be</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always consider the unintended consequences.</li>\n<li>Encourage Seventh Generation thinking: ask how the group's actions now will affect people seven generations from now.</li>\n<li>Ensure that any cost/benefit analysis includes all the costs, not just the financial ones (i.e., cost in morale, credibility, use of resources.)</li>\n<li>Include process goals that speak to how you want to do your work, and hold people accountable to those standards.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- This is probably the single defining characteristic of techology: \"progress\" is narrowly defined as boundless growth. At best, unintended consequences may get some lip service but is rarely seriously considered. -->\n<h3>Quantity over quality</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similarly to \"progress is bigger/more\" - all organization resources are directed toward producing measurable goals.</li>\n<li>Things that can be measured are more highly valued than things that cannot (i.e., numbers of people attending a meeting, newsletter circulation).</li>\n<li>Things that cannot be measured are dismissed (i.e., quality of relationships, democratic decision-making, ability to constructively deal with conflict)</li>\n<li>There is little or no value attached to the process.</li>\n<li>Participants show discomfort or disdain with emotion and feelings, particularly from BIPOC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include process or quality goals in your planning.</li>\n<li>Make a clear mission/values statement that expresses how you want to do your work.</li>\n<li>Ensure this is a living document and that people are using it in their day to day work.</li>\n<li>Recognize that not everything is quantifiable, and keep this in mind as the organization considers ways to \"measure\" goals.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- The corporate tech world worships quantitative data. Even in UX, a field which claims to be \"human-centered\" and grounded in empathy, success is always defined as a hard metric. For example, the success of web applications are defined by \"engagement\" metrics, so designers intentionally exploit psychological principles to build addictive technologies. -->\n<h3>White defensiveness</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The organization is set up to protect power as it exists rather than clarify who has power and how they are expected to use it.</li>\n<li>Criticism of those with power is viewed as threatening and inappropriate (or rude).</li>\n<li>People respond to new or challenging ideas with defensiveness, making it very difficult to raise these ideas.</li>\n<li>A lot of energy in the organization is spent trying to make sure that people's feelings aren't getting hurt or working around defensive people.</li>\n<li>In racialized settings, white people waste time and energy defending against racism charges rather than recognizing they - have a blind spot and sitting with the discomfort.</li>\n<li>The defensiveness of people in power creates an oppressive culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand that structure cannot in and of itself facilitate or prevent abuse.</li>\n<li>Understand the link between defensiveness and fear (i.e., losing power, losing face, losing comfort, losing privilege).</li>\n<li>Demand that white individuals work on their defensiveness. Name the problem when it is one.</li>\n<li>Recognize white tears. In racialized contexts, a white woman crying will always be taken as the truth.</li>\n<li>Recognize when a BIPOC is being painted in racial stereotypes (i.e., the angry Black woman or the silent Asian woman).</li>\n<li>Recognize that BIPOC have already spent a lifetime tempering their emotional responses by merely existing in a white supremacist culture.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- In a recent project, I was working with a teammate who was particularly reactive to an anti-racism workshop and kept wasting time unloading her emotions out onto me and my other teammates. I reached out to a friend who rightfully reminded me that simply being non-white does not necessarily qualify me to speak on issues of racism. Trying to justify my own (and other BIPOC's) existence(s) to white people is emotional labor that I did not have training, resources, or monetary compensation for.\n\nTo preserve my sanity, I pulled back (which got me typecasted as the \"silent Asian woman\"). When things got worse, I demanded boundaries (which got me typecasted as the \"problematic woman of color\"). Damned if I do, damned if I don't. -->\n<h3>Right to comfort</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People in the organization believe that those with power (white people) have a right to emotional and psychological comfort (another aspect of valuing 'logic' over emotion).</li>\n<li>People who highlight problems get scapegoated for causing discomfort (i.e., when a BIPOC brings up racism).</li>\n<li>Individual acts of unfairness against white people are equated with the systemic racism that BIPOC face every day.</li>\n<li>Tone policing is rampant.</li>\n<li>White people demand \"safe\" spaces for themselves without understanding that BIPOC live in toxic environments by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit with the discomfort and understand that discomfort is at the root of all growth and learning.</li>\n<li>Deepen your political analysis of racism and oppression. White supremacy is more than individual acts of ill-intent.</li>\n<li>Do not allow white people to waste time and space trying to explain their good intent (good intent does not cancel harmful impact).</li>\n<li>Do not demand more uncompensated emotional labor from BIPOC.</li>\n<li>Understand that what is \"safe\" for white people is not the same as what is \"safe\" for BIPOC.</li>\n<li>Respect and enforce the boundaries demanded by BIPOC.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Either/or thinking</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything exists in a binary. Things are either/or, good/bad, right/wrong, with us/against us.</li>\n<li>There is no sense that multiple perspectives can be valid. </li>\n<li>Complex social problems are oversimplified (i.e., poverty is simply a result of lack of education or climate change can be solved with electric cars.)</li>\n<li>Creates conflict and increases a sense of urgency, as people feel they have to make decisions to do either this or that (rather than both/and), with no time or encouragement to consider alternatives, particularly those that may require more time or resources </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notice and call out when people use 'either/or' language and push to develop more than two alternatives.</li>\n<li>Notice when people simplify complex issues, particularly when the stakes seem high or an urgent decision needs to be made.</li>\n<li>Encourage more in-depth analyses (see the CLA analysis framework).</li>\n<li>Avoid making decisions under extreme pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Objectivity</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People believe that there is such a thing as being objective or 'neutral.'</li>\n<li>People believe that emotions are inherently destructive, irrational and should not play a role in decision-making or group process.</li>\n<li>People (especially BIPOC) who show emotion are invalidated.</li>\n<li>Impatience with any thinking that does not appear 'logical.'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognize and honor different philosophical lenses or worldviews.</li>\n<li>Recognize that other people, particularly BIPOC, have lived experiences that white people will never understand. Honor those lived experiences as valid. </li>\n<li>Assume that everybody has a valid point, and your job is to understand what that point is.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Power hoarding</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Leaders\" are authoritarian.</li>\n<li>Power is seen as limited, only so much to go around.</li>\n<li>Those with power feel threatened with accountability.</li>\n<li>Those with power assume they have the organization's best interests at heart and assume those wanting changes are ill-informed (stupid), emotional, or inexperienced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidotes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a mission/values statement that articulates how those in power are expected to use and share that power.</li>\n<li>A good leader cultivates the unique power and skills of others. Hold your leaders accountable to this standard.</li>\n<li>Recognize and remove people who are in leadership roles for their egos rather than focusing on the mission.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n      <div class=\"footnotes\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ol >\n    \n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-1\" >\n          \n        \n      <a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;text-decoration: none;\">\n        ^\n      </a>\n    <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline;
