## Systemic racism and police brutality

If we haven’t been living under a rock, most of us have heard about the inherent racism built into our criminal punishment systems (as well as nearly every other American institution). The murder of George Floyd has renewed interest in the modern abolitionist movement which strives to dismantle modern policing and prison industrial complex, [which is deeply rooted in white supremacy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/angela-davis-on-george-floyd-as-long-as-the-violence-of-racism-remains-no-one-is-safe). As Mariame Kaba writes in the NYT,

> “Policing in the South emerged from the slave patrols in the 1700 and 1800s that caught and returned runaway slaves. In the North, the first municipal police departments in the mid-1800s helped quash labor strikes and riots against the rich. [(2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html)”

A more nuanced discussion of the prison industrial complex and transformative justice is beyond my expertise, but modern abolitionists such as [Angela Davis](https://time.com/5793638/angela-davis-100-women-of-the-year/), [Mariame Kaba](https://twitter.com/prisonculture), [Josie Duffy Rice](https://twitter.com/jduffyrice), [Jessica Disu](https://twitter.com/fmsupreme), [Nikkita Oliver](https://twitter.com/NikkitaOliver), and countless others have devoted years and decades to writing and organizing for this movement. The premise is that modern policing in America evolved for the purpose of protecting power and capital (white supremacy, in other words). Rampant racial profiling and police brutality towards Black and brown communities is yet another symptom of this system.
