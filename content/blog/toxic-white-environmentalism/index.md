> “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice…” — [Martin Luther King, Jr. (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)

## Beware the climate karens

The mainstream climate movement tends to frame climate change as a global issue, [though it is frontline communities who bear the brunt of climate effects](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7ggqx/people-of-color-experience-climate-grief-more-deeply-than-white-people). In the United States, Black and Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by climate issues. Outside of the U.S., the Global South pays to fund the Global North’s indulgent lifestyles.

While climate change continues to be [deeply polarized among party lines](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/) and has a stronger association with the Democratic party, the mainstream climate movement is also [overwhelmingly white](https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/els/files/2014/02/FullReport_Green2.0_FINALReducedSize.pdf), making it a bastion for performative, white environmentalists.

Meanwhile, the mainstream climate movement consistently [excludes, silences, and speaks over voices from front lines](https://heated.world/p/the-climate-movements-silence). On an institutional and individual level, the rampant racial gaslighting from white environmentalists makes the mainstream climate movement incredibly toxic for BIPOC environmentalists.

The toxic white environmentalist’s danger is that they’re more [deceitful and hypocritical](https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&psid=3619). Climate-deniers are easy to spot, but toxic white environmentalists act as [racial narcissists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aZKNck6LDE), virtue-signaling to gain tokenized BIPOC environmentalists’ trust.

## A personal anecdote

For a recent project, I attended an anti-racism workshop with a white environmentalist I was working with. That white environmentalist walked out and spent the next 3 months lambasting the workshop and the environmental justice movement for being too “divisive,” not focusing on enough “solutions,” and not centering the “social safety” of “moderates” like herself. She also explicitly “scoped” her solution to exclude racial issues, exemplifying white narcissism by centering her feelings above the actual lives of those in the frontline communities. For months, she used white tears, self-victimization, and blatant lies and gaslighting to evade any form of accountability and self-reflection. In addition, being in a primarily white institution meant that no one would hold her accountable either, and my request for boundaries was continually dismissed.

In environmentalism, these behaviors aren’t just monumentally annoying, they are weaponized to silence and erase the most immediate, pressing issues that threaten the lives of frontline communities, thus upholding the systems of white supremacy.

## Towards an intersectional environmentalism

To survive toxic white environmentalism, understand what [white](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amy-cooper-knew-exactly-what-she-was-doing_n_5ecd1d89c5b6c1f281e0fbc5) [tears](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/how-white-women-use-strategic-tears-to-avoid-accountability) are. Familiarize yourself with the [DARVO technique](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBAAOX3HN7c/), [7 Circles of Whiteness](https://medium.com/@alishiamccullough/the-7-circles-of-whiteness-cb60e53d14e0), and [racial gaslighting](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA82O3YlqUS/) and [narcissism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aZKNck6LDE) so you can quickly recognize the red flags and walk away. Ensure that you have genuine allies by your side. Remember that the “[performatively woke](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/better-left-unsaid/article/2018/10/1/gray-performing-wokeness/) person takes up a lot of space [while the ally makes space](https://medium.com/@Tawdry_Hepburn/on-allyship-and-performative-wokeness-30581808bf8b).” And remember that [even the most critical institutions may not protect you](https://medium.com/the-faculty/white-academia-do-better-fa96cede1fc5). If you are in academia, you may find this [survival guide](https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-survival-guide-for-black-indigenous-and-other-women-of-color-in-academe) helpful. The toxic white environmentalist is simply another form of the white moderate. Do what you need to do to survive.

Until someone invents a way to harness the boundless energy of a white woman’s tears, BIPOC environmentalists should seek out climate justice or intersectional environmentalist spaces where their voice will be heard and honored. After my project, I joined [a long lineage of BIPOC environmentalists](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5x5ny/why-i-quit-being-a-climate-activist) that grew irredeemably frustrated with the mainstream climate movement. In the process, I also recognized how Black and Indigenous environmentalists had led the climate movement ([among other movements](https://zora.medium.com/sorry-yall-but-climate-change-ain-t-the-first-existential-threat-b3c999267aa0)) for decades. The revolution will be intersectional.
