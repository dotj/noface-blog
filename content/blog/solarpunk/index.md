<!-- # INTRO -->

Solarpunk is a speculative genre and movement which seeks to envision a better future beyond the climate crisis. If cyberpunk is the cynical vision of what our futures could look like by continuing to follow the status quo, solarpunk is the radically hopeful vision.

To merely call solarpunk “positive” would be a gross understatement of the movement, however. Like other punk movements, these visions start with a deep interrogation and rejection of the status quo.  Solarpunk visionaries don’t rely on a shallow, blind optimism but rather a radical hope that begins by first reckoning with the painful reality of how deeply rotten our social systems are and having the courage to envision something new.

The solarpunk movement is, as its name suggests, heavily inspired by solar technologies and a culture of abundance. The most common aesthetic is that of art nouveau, a nod to the blending of art and function. From a western perspective, some examples of solarpunk in the real world might include guerilla gardening and grafting, seed/flower bombs, and DIY networks.



<!-- # CLOSING -->

As 2020 draws to an end, I hope we can refuse to grow neatly and to refuse to allow our larger systems to limit our imaginations.
